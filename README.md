# Abstract 
This project will be a web application that allows a student to login, enter what major they are, and see what classes are needed for them to graduate. It will also tell a student whether they should take 3 or 4 credit courses based on their graduation date, improving their ability to plan courses out. Once finished, this project will allow students to keep track of classes taken, classes needed, prerequisites, and graduation date. 
# Motivation
The motivation for this project is the unfortunate smoke and mirrors game of figuring out what courses need to be taken at UTPB, especially as a Computer Science major. Some advisors say certain classes are required, others say they arenâ€™t. Others get to their last semester and find they are just one or two credits shy of graduating, making it very hard to find a class to fill the role. Our degree map web application will make this process a simpler and more intuitive.
